# Facial-Expression-Classification-Using-Residual-Neural-Nets-
In this project, we will train a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect facial expressions. This project could be practically used for detecting customer emotions and facial expressions
